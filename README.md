# Recipe-Review-Analysis
Final project for DSC 80, regarding doing meaningful analysis on a dataset containing recipes and the reviews associated with them.

Our datasets consist of 2 csv files. The first is RAW_interactions.csv, which contains a user ID, recipe ID, and then the review and rating a user left. The other is RAW_recipes.csv, which gives us information about the recipes themselves. This includes the tags on the recipe, number of steps, nutrition facts, etc. The one question our project centers around is "Do unhealthier recipes have higher ratings and can we predict the rating a user gives a recipe based on the variables in our dataframe?" This question is interesting because it gives some insight into why people enjoy certain recipes more than others. Is it simply that certain recipes just taste better, or could it be the work that goes into making a meal and whether people naturally enjoy unhealthier recipes? By creating a model and identifying the most significant variables, we can see what types of recipes people naturally gravitate towards.<br><br><br><br>

### Cleaning Prcoess
First, we began by loading in the 2 datasets and following the processes outlined in the write-up. We merged recipes and reviews by keeping recipes and merging on the recipe ID. We filled in ratings of 0 with np.nan because ... We then converted the date reviews were left to datetime to make it easier if we wanted to utilize this column later in the project. We then converted our discrete variables to integers, like number of minutes, number of steps, etc. The most modification we did was extracting the daily value nutritional facts for each macronutrient. We extracted the saturated fat, calories, sugar, etc. to become their own columns and converted their values to integers.

This grouped table shows us how each quantitative variable breaks down over each rating category. This table is incredibly helpful because it helps us identify which variables might be significant when it comes to determining a recipes rating.

### Univariate Analysis
![ratings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39f2a355-2004-41f2-a6aa-2e53fb402f7e)

<br><br>
Here is a histogram detailing the distributions of ratings in our dataframe. As you can see, people disproportionately leave 5 star reviews. 4 stars is the next most common rating, although much less frequent than 5 star reviews. This shows that, at least in our dataset, people only leave reviews when they feel strongly positive about a recipe.

### Bivariate Analysis
![sat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dab4da0d-9254-470e-af99-bbcb4630db98)
![minutes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93969cb-fc70-47ad-b88f-d98d17f0dab5)



<br>
Here we attempted to establish a relationship between the healthiness and the minutes required for our recipes and the ratings associated with them. We initially believed that people would rate recipes with higher Saturated Fat contents higher because people generally enjoy the tastes of unhealthier foods. However, this boxplot shows little difference between the average Saturated Fat in each rating category. The same goes for minutes, although it does seem like higher ratings are usually from slightly faster recipes (35 minute medians for 4 and 5 stars, 40 minutes for all other categories).


<br>

### Hypothesis Testing

$H_{0}$: All recipe ratings regardless of the recipe's tags are part of the same rating distribution.
$H_{0}$: Recipes marked easy (have the tag '3-steps-or-less', 'easy', or 'beginner-cook')
<br>
We created an easy df with an extra column determining whether or not these tags exist in a recipe's tags. 0.58 recipes were classified as 'easy', a good divide to test on. We then permuted the 'easy' column 3000 times, and observed whether the means were more extreme than 0.01, the difference in mean ratings. Through our test, we got a p-value of 0.01, showing that recipes with easy tags have a higher distribution of ratings.
