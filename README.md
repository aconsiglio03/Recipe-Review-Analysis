# Recipe-Review-Analysis
Final project for DSC 80, regarding doing meaningful analysis on a dataset containing recipes and the reviews associated with them.


### Introduction
Our datasets consist of 2 csv files. The first is RAW_interactions.csv, which contains a user ID, recipe ID, and then the review and rating a user left. The other is RAW_recipes.csv, which gives us information about the recipes themselves. This includes the tags on the recipe, number of steps, nutrition facts, etc. The one question our project centers around is "Do unhealthier recipes have higher ratings and can we predict the rating a recipe recieves based on the attributes of that recipe?" This question is interesting because it gives some insight into why people enjoy certain recipes more than others. Is it simply that certain recipes just taste better, or could it be the work that goes into making a meal and whether people naturally enjoy unhealthier recipes? By creating a model and identifying the most significant variables, we can see what types of recipes people naturally gravitate towards. The initial dataset has 234428 rows and 18 columns. We utilized nearly all columns of the dataset aside from 'review', since when predicting the rating of a recipe we can assume that we wouldn't have access to user reviews.
<br><br>
**'minutes'**: Minutes to prepare recipe\
**'id'**:	Recipe ID\
**'contributor_id'**:	User ID who submitted this recipe\
**'submitted'**:	Date recipe was submitted\
**'tags'**:	Food.com tags for recipe\
**'nutrition'**:	Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value”, which we extracted\
**'n_steps'**:	Number of steps in recipe\
**'steps'**:	Text for recipe steps, in order\
**'description'**:	User-provided description\
**'rating'**:	Rating given

### Cleaning Process
First, we began by loading in the 2 datasets and following the processes outlined in the write-up. We merged recipes and reviews by keeping recipes and merging on the recipe ID. We filled in ratings of 0 with np.nan because we believe that these are responses where people didn't leave a rating. We then converted the date reviews were left to datetime to make it easier if we wanted to utilize this column later in the project. We then converted our discrete variables to integers, like number of minutes, number of steps, etc. The most modification we did was extracting the daily value nutritional facts for each macronutrient. We extracted the saturated fat, calories, sugar, etc. to become their own columns and converted their values to integers. We also filtered out incredibly large values in our daily value columns, as we believe they represent the DV if someone was to eat the entire portion. For example, we found calories of more than 5000. We also filtered out rows with absurdly large 'minutes' values. Our threshold was 600 minutes (10 hours).

I made my own chicken soup for this recipe. I was a bit worried about the tsp of soy sauce but it gave the casserole the best flavor. YUM!                                                                                                                                  |            5 |      194.8 |             20 |          6 |          32 |           22 |           36 |         3 |

This grouped table shows us how each quantitative variable breaks down over each rating category. This table is incredibly helpful because it helps us identify which variables might be significant when it comes to determining a recipes rating.

### Univariate Analysis
![ratings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39f2a355-2004-41f2-a6aa-2e53fb402f7e)

<br><br>
Here is a histogram detailing the distributions of ratings in our dataframe. As you can see, people disproportionately leave 5 star reviews. 4 stars is the next most common rating, although much less frequent than 5 star reviews. This shows that, at least in our dataset, people only leave reviews when they feel strongly positive about a recipe.

### Bivariate Analysis
![sat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dab4da0d-9254-470e-af99-bbcb4630db98)
![minutes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93969cb-fc70-47ad-b88f-d98d17f0dab5)



<br>
Here we attempted to establish a relationship between the healthiness and the minutes required for our recipes and the ratings associated with them. We initially believed that people would rate recipes with higher Saturated Fat contents higher because people generally enjoy the tastes of unhealthier foods. However, this boxplot shows little difference between the average Saturated Fat in each rating category. The same goes for minutes, although it does seem like higher ratings are usually from slightly faster recipes (35 minute medians for 4 and 5 stars, 40 minutes for all other categories).


<br><br><br><br>


### Assessment of Missingness

One column we know to be NMAR is 'Rating'. This is because we were advised to replace ratings of 0 starts with np.nan during our cleaning process because they result from someone not leaving a rating. Therefore, 'Rating' is missing dependent on the value of the rating itself, making it NMAR.

#### Analysis on 'Description'

![desc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bf2470f-7aa2-45ef-83a7-453779f37c86)


![descnot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e60ed7b5-2892-4b9d-b84e-3bf6bf2c1836)


<br><br>
To check if 'Description' was MAR on 'Rating' we performed a permutation test that iterated 3000 times. We got a significantly low p value when using the absolute difference of means of 0.013. We see this significant difference in the histograms of 'Rating' when 'Description' is missing or not missing. We found 'Description' to not be MAR on 'Number of Steps', i.e., 'Number of Steps' had no effect on the missingness of the 'Description' column. For that permutation test we got a p value of 0.21.


<br>

### Hypothesis Testing

$H_{0}$: All recipe ratings regardless of the recipe's tags are part of the same rating distribution.\
$H_{1}$: Recipes marked easy (have the tag '3-steps-or-less', 'easy', or 'beginner-cook') have a higher rating distribution.
<br>
We created an easy df with an extra column determining whether or not these tags exist in a recipe's tags. 0.58 recipes were classified as 'easy', a good divide to test on. We then permuted the 'easy' column 5000 times, and observed whether the means were more extreme than 0.01, the difference in mean ratings. Through our test, we got a p-value of 0.0004, so we reject our null hypothesis and instead hypothesize that recipes with tags referring to their easiness have a higher distribution of ratings.

<br>
We also did a hypothesis test on Low vs High sugar recipes (cutoff at 20% of daily value).

$H_{0}$: All recipe ratings regardless of the sugar are part of the same rating distribution.\
$H_{1}$: Recipes with lower sugar (<20% of daily value) have a higher rating distribution.
<br><br>
We created a sugar df with a column for low sugar (marked by our cutoff) and performed  5000 iterations of our hypothesis test, and found a p value of 0.0002. This is a very significant value, and allows us to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that recipes with sugar DV <20% have a higher rating distribution in our dataset.

### Framing a Prediction Problem

For our model we wanted to predict the 'rating' column of our data because we thought it was the most interesting variable. It tells you very simply and clearly whether or not people enjoyed the recipe and if they would recommend it to others. Because we need to build a model that takes into consideration the data we would have at the time, we only utilized variables given in the original recipe, nothing from a user's review. If we're able to create a successful model that uses attributes of a recipe, we're able to get some insight as to what makes a good recipe, and why people may be drawn to specific kinds of recipes. Since we're only using information from the recipes, we grouped each unique recipe and created a column 'avg_rating' which states the mean rating of each recipe. We then rounded the means to the nearest whole number, because we believed we'd have better luck creating a **classifier** model rather than a regression model. Because ratings have 5 'classes' (1-5 stars), this is a **multiclass** classification.

### Baseline Model


<br><br>

### Final Model


<br><br>

### Fairness Model

Because our model regards recipes and ratings, it wasn't immediately apparent what groups we would analyze to ensure fairness. Thinking more in depth, we realized that we should take into account whether our model is assessing certain ethnic foods differently than the rest of the data. We took a few subsets of data for recipes that contained "chinese", "african", "indian", etc. to test our model on.
